	URL: http://localhost:8080/FileConverter/
	
What the Servlet will do:
1. The UI displays 3 input fields for the Meta data, Data and Destination file location. The screen is equipped with appropriate validation.
2. Once all the inputs have been filled in, click the "Convert to CSV" button.
3. If the process meets with an error, you will be rediredted to an error page. Since this project has been treated as the developer's version of the tool, the error page displays the stack trace.
	The error page has a "Back to Home Page" link to go back to the home page and retry the file transfer.
4. If the conversion is successful, you are redirected back tot he home page with a success message. The success message will contain the name of the CSV file that is generated.
